/**
 * THE owner of the scope draft on the host side: it holds the current revision, applies the changes a
 * scoping turn proposes, and persists the result. The model proposes; this class decides and stores.
 * <p>
 * Two rules it enforces, both learned the hard way:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a DAMAGED persisted draft is never silently replaced by an empty one — the coordinator refuses to
 *     work rather than throw away decisions the user already made;</li>
 * <li>a failed WRITE does not corrupt the in-memory state: the draft is only adopted once it is on disk,
 *     so a retry starts from what is actually persisted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * It deliberately knows nothing about phases, commands or readiness — the user owns the state machine.
