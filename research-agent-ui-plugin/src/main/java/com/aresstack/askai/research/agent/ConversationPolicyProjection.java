/**
 * The RATIFIED conversation policy (Phase-1 Bauplan): an EPHEMERAL, stateless projection —
 * signals in, ONE stage + host-guidance hint out, recomputed per user turn, never persisted,
 * never a second state machine. Stages derive from the INTERPLAY of growth/novelty, OPEN
 * boundary material and the current scope check — never from anchor counts, never from a
 * magic card number (counts only mark "still sparse").
 *
 * <p>Ratified guards baked in: {@code READY} means a TRUSTWORTHY sweep, never "scope
 * complete"; {@code NOTHING_TO_ASK} never means "done" — CLOSURE_CHECK only says "no strong
 * boundary question is known right now" and leaves the decision with the user.
 * {@code CALIBRATION_WEAK} is not a weaker READY: it never supports closure and only adds a
 * conservative note. A stale report (its scope revision no longer current) is IGNORED.
 * Novelty counts NEW positive concept-node IDs per user turn — renames and moves mint no ids
 * and are correctly no novelty.</p>
