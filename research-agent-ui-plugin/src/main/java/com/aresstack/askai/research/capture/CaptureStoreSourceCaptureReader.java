/**
 * The productive {@link SourceCaptureReader}: reads an accepted capture from the per-session {@link CaptureStore}
 * and maps it losslessly to the canonical {@link SourceCapture} via {@link VisitedCaptureSourceCaptureAdapter}.
 * It resolves the capture's owning source id through an injected {@link SourceIdResolver} (provenance only) so
 * the reader stays free of the source repository for the in-memory path.
 *
 * <p>DURABLE fallback (issue #29): the in-memory capture store is bounded working material — after a restart
 * (or eviction) the capture is gone, but the accepted source record persisted its full cleaned text. When the
 * job carries the accepted source id, a missing in-memory capture falls back to the PERSISTED
 * {@link ResearchSourceRecord} so a delayed, user-triggered segmentation still has its canonical input. Only
 * when neither exists does the worker see {@code null} (a permanent failure).</p>
