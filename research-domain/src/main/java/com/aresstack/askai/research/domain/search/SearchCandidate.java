/**
 * ONE hit a search produced: an IMMUTABLE discovery record, addressable by its {@link #getCandidateId()} for
 * the rest of the project's life — "open hit #18 again, properly" must not require running the search again.
 * <p>
 * It deliberately carries NO inspection state. A candidate can be looked at more than once: skipped under a
 * scan profile, blocked by a consent dialog on the first attempt, read successfully on a later one. Letting
 * the hit itself walk through DISCOVERED → FAILED → INSPECTED would rewrite the discovery fact every time
 * something happened to the page, and "deepen this hit" (a NEW inspection) would look like a state change of
 * an old one. What happened to a page lives in {@link InspectionAttempt}; a UI may project the latest
 * attempt, but the canonical truth stays separate.
 * <p>
 * Two further things it is NOT:
 * <ul>
 * <li>NOT a navigation target — the acquisition frontier also holds links found while reading, which have no
 *     rank and no snippet.</li>
 * <li>NOT a source. A run may find a hundred candidates of which five enter the research corpus; the
 *     relation is candidate → inspection → source, not equality.</li>
 * </ul>
