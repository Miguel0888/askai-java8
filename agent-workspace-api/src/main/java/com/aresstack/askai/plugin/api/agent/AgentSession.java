 * contributes, and a generic {@link AgentStateSnapshot}. Its backend activity is delivered to the shared chat
 * through the {@link AgentConversationSink} it was given at creation.
 *
 * <p>Threading &amp; ownership: created by an {@link AgentSessionFactory}, driven on the UI thread, and closed
 * exactly once. After {@link #close()} no further conversation-sink call must happen.</p>
