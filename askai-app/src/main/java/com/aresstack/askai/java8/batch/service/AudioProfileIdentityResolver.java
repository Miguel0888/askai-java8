/**
 * The contract for persisted audio-profile identities in batch Markdown documents.
 *
 * <p>A persisted profile id must never be Java {@code null}, empty, whitespace-only, or the literal
 * string {@code "null"} (older writer versions string-concatenated a missing id, producing exactly these
 * corrupt values). {@link #isValidId} is that rule in one place: the writer refuses invalid ids and the
 * parser treats them as absent.
 *
 * <p>{@link #resolveLegacyProfileId} migrates legacy sections that carry no usable id: the visible heading
 * name is resolved against the built-in profiles (Off → {@code off}, Default speech →
 * {@code default-speech}, Crystal voice → {@code crystal-voice}), which are unique by construction. A user
 * profile without a safe id is NOT guessed — it stays id-less and is matched by its exact visible heading
 * on the next upsert (gaining the entry's real id then), so no random or wrong identity is ever invented.
