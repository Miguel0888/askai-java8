 * Visualize one explainable agent/tool action as an amber animated thought bubble.

 * Complete the activity with a compact summary; the bubble then bursts and lets the summary rise and
 * fade like a strategy-game reward. All drawing/animation lives in {@link AnimatedThoughtBubblePanel};
 * this subclass only fixes the amber theme.</p>
