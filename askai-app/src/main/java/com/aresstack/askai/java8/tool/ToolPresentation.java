 * Produces the user-facing, public description of a tool action for the amber activity bubble. A tool

 * <p>Implementations must never surface raw tool JSON, full argument objects, credentials, tokens,
 * cookies, complete tool results or stack traces. {@code describePurpose} receives already-sanitized
 * arguments and should still only use them to phrase a safe explanation.</p>
