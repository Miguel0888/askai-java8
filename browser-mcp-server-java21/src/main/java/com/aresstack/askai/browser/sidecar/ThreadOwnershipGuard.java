 * Captures the thread it was created on and rejects use from any other thread. Playwright Java is not

 * thread runs a Playwright call — so every Playwright object in this sidecar is created and used on exactly
 * one owner thread (the {@link BrowserSessionActor} loop). This guard turns an accidental direct call from an
 * MCP HTTP worker into an immediate, readable failure instead of a latent race or a frozen browser.
