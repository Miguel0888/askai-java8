 * The CONTROL-PLANE buffer between the HUD overlay and the runtime: pure Java, thread-safe, and deliberately
 * OUTSIDE the {@link BrowserSessionActor} command queue. The {@code exposeBinding} callback (owner thread,

 * Skip/Pause must reach the runtime even while a data command (probe/read/open) is blocking the actor —
 * routing the drain through the actor would park the emergency control behind exactly the call it is meant
