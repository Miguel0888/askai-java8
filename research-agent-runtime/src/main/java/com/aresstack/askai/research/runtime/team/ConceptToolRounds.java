/**
 * The TOOL-ROUND loop of a conceptualization turn — deliberately NOT just a repair loop. With the
 * one-JSON-per-inference contract the model cannot read a branch and edit it within the SAME
 * inference, so each tool step is its own round: inference → conceptAction → host tool →
 * feedback → next inference. Three feedback kinds are kept explicit:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code TOOL_RESULT} — a regular read result (a working step, budget: tool rounds);</li>
 *   <li>{@code TOOL_APPLIED} — a mutation committed (working step as well);</li>
 *   <li>{@code TOOL_REJECTED} — a mutation refused with a diagnostic (counts against the
 *       SEPARATE repair budget, so error tolerance never eats the work budget or vice versa).</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both budgets are the user's settings (env hand-off), never hidden constants. When either budget
 * is exhausted the model gets ONE final wrap-up inference that explicitly forbids further actions;
 * an action it emits anyway is dropped with a trace line. An unreachable endpoint aborts the loop
 * and keeps the last good result — never a fabricated turn. The change semantics stay entirely in
 * the host's ConceptBranchService; this class only orchestrates.
