/**
 * The outcome of one TeamAgent turn (greeting or reply). Exactly one of three honest states:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Status#OK} — the model answered and the answer parsed; {@link #getTurn()} is the structured
 *       intent and {@link #getValidatedCommand()} is its proposed command IFF that command is currently
 *       allowed by the host state machine (else {@code null});</li>
 *   <li>{@link Status#MODEL_UNAVAILABLE} — the main model could not be reached (transport/timeout/HTTP);
 *       the caller shows an honest status and offers a retry, never a fabricated outline;</li>
 *   <li>{@link Status#UNUSABLE_ANSWER} — the model answered but, even after one bounded repair, produced no
 *       parseable turn; again an honest error, never invented content.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Status#COMMAND_REJECTED} — the model insisted on a command the host does not allow in the
 *       current state (even after a bounded repair). The illegal command is dropped AND its potentially
 *       misleading assistant message is withheld, so the model can never claim a step happened that did not.</li>
