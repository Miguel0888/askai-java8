/**
 * Collects the hits of one run into DISTINCT candidates without losing where each came from.
 * <p>
 * Deduplication is by normalized URL, and it is additive: a hit that appears on batch 1 and again on batch 3,
 * or that two providers return, becomes ONE candidate with several {@link SearchOccurrence}s. Neither
 * multiplying it into three candidates nor discarding two of the three appearances is acceptable — a
 * diversity-aware selection needs to see that a page was found repeatedly and by whom.
 * <p>
 * Ids are minted in first-appearance order and are stable for the life of the run, which is what makes a hit
 * addressable later ("open #18 again").
