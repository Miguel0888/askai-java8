/**
 * ONE navigation target the acquisition engine still has to work through — a runtime-internal work item,
 * deliberately NOT a search candidate.
 * <p>
 * The frontier is fed from several sources: selected search hits, links discovered on a visited page, and
 * URLs re-queued after a challenge was solved. Only the first kind has a rank, a snippet and a result page;
 * a discovered link has a parent page instead. Forcing all of them into one "candidate" type would mean
 * inventing ranks for links and losing the provenance that makes a later trace readable.
 * <p>
 * An entry that came from a search hit carries its {@link #getSearchCandidateId()}, so anything the engine
 * does with it can be reported back to exactly that candidate.
