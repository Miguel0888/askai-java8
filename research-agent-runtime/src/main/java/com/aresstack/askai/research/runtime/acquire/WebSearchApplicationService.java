/**
 * The deterministic web-acquisition engine, extracted VERBATIM from {@code ResearchLoop} (T2a): SearchStrategy
 * execution → mandatory reranking → frontier → redirect/canonical visited handling → search-provider transit
 * filtering → {@code web_open} → deterministic page relevance → {@link SourceAcceptancePort} → {@code web_links}
 * → link relevance/frontier expansion → challenge/deferred-domain handling → budgets → cancellation → terminal
 * acquisition stop reason. Every effect goes through MCP tools; decisions are content-driven.
 *
 * <p>It is caller-agnostic: the autonomous research loop and a user-triggered manual search both consume it.
 * It never signals PHASE_READY and never touches the state machine or the model. When it accepts a source
 * it notifies an {@link AcceptedSourceListener} AT THAT POINT (before {@code web_links}) so a caller can do
 * research-specific work there; since issue #32 both callers are no-ops (no findings artifact anymore).</p>
