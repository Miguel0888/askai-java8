/**
 * SC1 Search-Control: the runtime-side port to the HOST's semantic acquisition filter — the
 * second, ORTHOGONAL decision in the funnel. Query relevance ("does this answer my query?")
 * stays with the reranker/relevance model; scope control answers "may this enter the
 * negotiated research space at all?". NEVER a model tool: implementations ride the internal
 * research-service endpoint, structurally absent from the agent tool catalog.
 *
 * <p>Currency rule (deliberately different from scope_probe): a RUNNING search never goes
 * stale — {@link #begin()} pins one immutable snapshot, every {@link #evaluate} of the run
 * judges against it, the NEXT run sees the new fence. Page 1 and page 8 are judged against the
 * same research space.</p>
