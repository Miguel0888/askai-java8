/**
 * Persists the FINAL passage embedding vectors as a CANONICAL, versioned part of a capture's processing
 * generation — the missing half of "passage fact + its computed vector = persistent". The domain {@code Passage}
 * keeps only the model fingerprint (a vector is a rebuildable projection of the TEXT, but re-deriving it means
 * calling the embedding model again); persisting the vectors here makes the semantic index rebuildable WITHOUT
 * re-embedding.
 *
 * <p>Vectors live in the SAME generation directory as the sentences/passages, keyed by the derivation identity
 * (captureId + segmentationPipelineVersion + embeddingFingerprint + languageCode). They are written BEFORE the repository swaps
 * the capture's active pointer, so a generation is "complete" only once sentences + passages + vectors are all
 * on disk — the active pointer stays the single commit point (a crash before it keeps the previous generation
 * fully active). Loading returns exactly the requested generation's vectors, so superseded generations never
 * bleed into the active search space.</p>
