/**
 * Persists the sentences, passages AND their embedding vectors of one processed capture as a single canonical
 * generation. The productive adapter records sentences/passages onto the {@code research-domain}
 * {@code ResearchProject} aggregate (via {@code recordSentences}/{@code recordPassages}) and the vectors through
 * a {@link PassageVectorStore}, saving through {@code ResearchProjectRepository} — the project directory stays
 * the single source of truth; the semantic index is a rebuildable projection of exactly this data.
 *
 * <p>A generation is complete only once sentences + passages + vectors are all on disk; only THEN does the
 * capture's active pointer swap (the single commit point).</p>
